# cifar10_image_classification

This is an implementation of a CNN classifier for cifar10 using Pytorch. The purpose of this is to practice implmenting programs that are related to computer vision. The code in this repository drew reference from the offical pytorch mnist example and the official pytorch cifar10 tutorial.
